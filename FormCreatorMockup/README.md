This was an afternoon project I had done earlier this summer. I was attempting to create a working prototype for an online form generator that would allow users to create files from an existing template (saved in a specific file type), download their created templates, or create new templates.
This was originally going to be a prototype I was going to make for my mom's startup company (creating software to record information for medical trials). The main goal was to get the functionality down, then work on the UI. However, the startup never got anywhere, and I had to study for my AI Practitioner certification exam.
I used Amazon's PartyRock to generate HTML and JavaScript code that I would later heavily refactor and rewrite. Were it not for AI, this would've taken at least a few days.
